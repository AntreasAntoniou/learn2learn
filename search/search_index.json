Learned Optimizers that Scale and Generalize by Wichrowska, Olga and Maheswaranathan, Niru and Hoffman, Matthew W and Colmenarejo, Sergio Gomez and Denil, Misha and de Freitas, Nando and Sohl-Dickstein, Jascha http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04813 Using learned optimizers to make models robust to input noise by Metz, Luke and Maheswaranathan, Niru and Shlens, Jonathon and Sohl-Dickstein, Jascha and Cubuk, Ekin D http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03367 Learning to Optimize Neural Nets by Li, Ke and Malik, Jitendra http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00441 Meta-Learning Update Rules for Unsupervised Representation Learning by Metz, Luke and Maheswaranathan, Niru and Cheung, Brian and Sohl-Dickstein, Jascha http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00222 Learning to Optimize by Li, Ke and Malik, Jitendra http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01885 Learning to learn by gradient descent by gradient descent by Andrychowicz, M and Denil, M and Gomez, S http://learn2learn.net Online Learning Rate Adaptation with Hypergradient Descent by Baydin, Atilim Gunes and Cornish, Robert and Rubio, David Martinez and Schmidt, Mark and Wood, Frank http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04782 They adapt the learning rate of SGD by differentiating the loss of the next parameters w.r.t. the learning rate. They observe that the gradient of the learning rate is simply the inner product of the last two gradients. Adapting Bias by Gradient Descent: An Incremental Version of Delta-Bar-Delta by Sutton, Richard S http://dx.doi.org/ What's mostly interesting in this paper is the adaptation of delta-bar-delta to the online scenario. The idea of representing the learning rate as an exponential is nice. Also nice to see that the derivation suggests a full-matrix adaptive case. Gain adaptation beats least squares by Sutton, Richard S https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7ec8/876f219b3b3d5c894a3f395c89c382029cc5.pdf This paper extends IDBD as algorithms K1 and K2, but from my quick read, it isn't clear what's the motivation for those modifications. (Seems to work in a `normalized space'', {\\ a} la natural gradient ?)They do work better. Local Gain Adaptation in Stochastic Gradient Descent by Schraudolph, Nicol N https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/31a0/b86c3cd04e6539626f34b80db7ff79d23f40.pdf This algorithm extends IDBD (Sutton) to the non-linear setting. Interestingly, they have a few brief discussionson the difficulties to optimize at the meta-level. (c.f. Meta-level conditioning section.) Overall, it shines light on the ground idea behind IDBD. TIDBD: Adapting Temporal-difference Step-sizes Through Stochastic Meta-descent by Kearney, Alex and Veeriah, Vivek and Travnik, Jaden B and Sutton, Richard S and Pilarski, Patrick M http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03334 Increased rates of convergence through learning rate adaptation by Jacobs, Robert A http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0893608088900032 This paper argues that we need (at least) four ingredients to improve optimization of connectionist networks: 1. each parameter has its own stepsize, 2. stepsizes vary over time, 3. if consecutive gradients of a stepsize have the same sign, the stepsize should be increased, 4. conversely, if the stepsize should be decreased if its gradients have opposite signs. It also proposes to use two improvements: 1. Momentum (i.e. Polyak's heavyball), 2. delta-bar-delta (i.e. learning the stepsize). It has an interesting comment on the difficulty of learning the stepsize, and therefore comes up with a ``hack'' that outperforms momentum. Meta-descent for Online, Continual Prediction by Jacobsen, Andrew and Schlegel, Matthew and Linke, Cameron and Degris, Thomas and White, Adam and White, Martha http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.07751 The idea is to learn the learning rate so as to minimize the norm of the gradient. They argue that for the continual learning setting, this forces the algorithm to stay ``as stable as possible''. No theorems, small-scale (but interesting) experiments.

They observe that the gradient of the learning rate is simply the inner product of the last two gradients. Adapting Bias by Gradient Descent: An Incremental Version of Delta-Bar-Delta by Sutton, Richard S http://dx.doi.org/ What's mostly interesting in this paper is the adaptation of delta-bar-delta to the online scenario. The idea of representing the learning rate as an exponential is nice. Also nice to see that the derivation suggests a full-matrix adaptive case. Gain adaptation beats least squares by Sutton, Richard S https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7ec8/876f219b3b3d5c894a3f395c89c382029cc5.pdf This paper extends IDBD as algorithms K1 and K2, but from my quick read, it isn't clear what's the motivation for those modifications. (Seems to work in a `normalized space'', {\\ a} la natural gradient ?)They do work better. Local Gain Adaptation in Stochastic Gradient Descent by Schraudolph, Nicol N https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/31a0/b86c3cd04e6539626f34b80db7ff79d23f40.pdf This algorithm extends IDBD (Sutton) to the non-linear setting. Interestingly, they have a few brief discussionson the difficulties to optimize at the meta-level. (c.f. Meta-level conditioning section.) Overall, it shines light on the ground idea behind IDBD. TIDBD: Adapting Temporal-difference Step-sizes Through Stochastic Meta-descent by Kearney, Alex and Veeriah, Vivek and Travnik, Jaden B and Sutton, Richard S and Pilarski, Patrick M http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03334 Increased rates of convergence through learning rate adaptation by Jacobs, Robert A http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0893608088900032 This paper argues that we need (at least) four ingredients to improve optimization of connectionist networks: 1. each parameter has its own stepsize, 2. stepsizes vary over time, 3. if consecutive gradients of a stepsize have the same sign, the stepsize should be increased, 4. conversely, if the stepsize should be decreased if its gradients have opposite signs. It also proposes to use two improvements: 1. Momentum (i.e. Polyak's heavyball), 2. delta-bar-delta (i.e. learning the stepsize). It has an interesting comment on the difficulty of learning the stepsize, and therefore comes up with a ``hack'' that outperforms momentum. Meta-descent for Online, Continual Prediction by Jacobsen, Andrew and Schlegel, Matthew and Linke, Cameron and Degris, Thomas and White, Adam and White, Martha http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.07751 The idea is to learn the learning rate so as to minimize the norm of the gradient. They argue that for the continual learning setting, this forces the algorithm to stay ``as stable as possible''. No theorems, small-scale (but interesting) experiments.

MetaDataset \u00b6 1 MetaDataset ( * args , ** kwds ) Description Wraps a classification dataset to enable fast indexing of samples within classes. This class exposes two attributes specific to the wrapped dataset: labels_to_indices : maps a class label to a list of sample indices with that label. indices_to_labels : maps a sample index to its corresponding class label. Those dictionary attributes are often used to quickly create few-shot classification tasks. They can be passed as arguments upon instantiation, or automatically built on-the-fly. If the wrapped dataset has an attribute _bookkeeping_path , then the built attributes will be cached on disk and reloaded upon the next instantiation.

A task transformation is an object that implements the callable interface. (Either a function or an object that implements the __call__ special method.) Each transformation is called on a task description, which consists of a list of DataDescription with attributes index and transforms , where index corresponds to the index of single data sample inthe dataset, and transforms is a list of transformations that will be applied to the sample. Each transformation must return a new task description. At first, the task description contains all samples from the dataset. A task transform takes this task description list and modifies it such that a particular task is created. For example, the NWays task transform filters data samples from the task description such that remaining ones belong to a random subset of all classes available. (The size of the subset is controlled via the class's n argument.) On the other hand, the LoadData task transform simply appends a call to load the actual data from the dataset to the list of transformations of each sample. To create a task from a task description, the TaskDataset applies each sample's list of transform s in order. Then, all samples are collated via the TaskDataset 's collate function.

The meta-training is performed on a set of 50 randomly chosen once initial object and goal positions. The meta-testing is performed on a held-out set of 10 new different configurations. The starting state of the robot arm is always fixed. The goal positions are not provided in the observation space, forcing the Sawyer robot arm to explore and adapt to the new goal through trial-and-error. This is considered a relatively easy problem for a meta-learning algorithm to solve and acts as a sanity check to a working implementation.

MetaWorldML10 \u00b6 1 MetaWorldML10 ( env_type = 'train' , sample_all = False , task_name = None ) [Source] Description The ML10 Benchmark of Meta-World consists of 10 different tasks for meta-training and 5 new tasks for meta-testing. For each task there is only one goal that is randomly chosen once. The starting state and object position is random. The meta-training tasks have been intentionally selected to have a structural similarity to the test tasks. No task ID is provided in the observation space, meaning the meta-learning algorithm will need to identify each task from experience. This is a much harder problem than ML1 which probably requires more samples to train. For more information regarding this benchmark, please consult [1].

ModuleTransform \u00b6 1 ModuleTransform ( module_cls ) [Source] Description The ModuleTransform creates a an optimization transform based on any nn.Module. ModuleTransform automatically instanciates a module from its class, based on a given parameter. The input and output shapes are of the module are set to (1, param.numel()) .

KroneckerTransform \u00b6 1 KroneckerTransform ( kronecker_cls , bias = False , psd = True ) [Source] Description The KroneckerTransform creates a an optimization transform based on nn.Module's that admit a Kronecker factorization. (see l2l.nn.Kronecker* ) Akin to the ModuleTransform, this class of transform instanciates a module from its class, based on a given parameter. But, instead of reshaping the gradients to shape (1, param.numel()) , this class assumes a Kronecker factorization of the weights for memory and computational efficiency. The specific dimension of the Kronecker factorization depends on the the parameter's shape. For a weight of shape (n, m), a KroneckerLinear transform consists of two weights with shapes (n, n) and (m, m) rather than a single weight of shape (nm, nm).

In this article, we will dive into a meta-learning algorithm called ANIL (Almost No Inner Loop) presented by Raghu et al., 2019 , and explain how to implement it with learn2learn. Note This tutorial is written for experienced PyTorch users who are getting started with meta-learning. Overview \u00b6 We look into how ANIL takes advantage of feature reuse for few-shot learning. ANIL simplifies MAML by removing the inner loop for all but the task-specific head of the underlying neural network. ANIL performs as well as MAML on benchmark few-shot classification and reinforcement learning tasks, and is computationally more efficient than MAML. We implement ANIL with learn2learn and provide additional results of how ANIL performs on other datasets. Lastly, we explain the implementation code step-be-step, making it easy for users to try ANIL on other datasets. ANIL algorithm \u00b6 Among various meta-learning algorithms for few-shot learning, MAML (model-agnostic meta-learning) (Finn et al. 2017) has been highly popular due to its substantial performance on several benchmarks. Its idea is to establish a meta-learner that seeks an initialization useful for fast learning of different tasks, then adapt to specific tasks quickly (within a few steps) and efficiently (with only a few examples). There are two types of parameter updates: the outer loop and the inner loop. The outer loop updates the meta-initialization of the neural network parameters to a setting that enables fast adaptation to new tasks. The inner loop takes the outer loop initialization and performs task-specific adaptation over a few labeled samples. To read more about meta-learning and MAML, you can read the summary article written by Finn on learning to learn and Lilian Weng's review on meta-learning . In 2019, Raghu et al. conjectured that we can obtain the same rapid learning performance of MAML solely through feature reuse. To test this hypothesis, they introduced ANIL (almost no inner loop), a simplified algorithm of MAML that is equally effective but computationally faster. Rapid learning vs. feature reuse Visualizations of rapid learning and feature reuse. Diagram from Raghu et al., 2019. Before we describe ANIL, we have to understand the difference between rapid learning and feature reuse. In rapid learning , the meta-initialization in the outer loop results in a parameter setting that is favorable for fast learning, thus significant adaptation to new tasks can rapidly take place in the inner loop. In feature reuse , the meta-initialization already contains useful features that can be reused, so little adaptation on the parameters is required in the inner loop. To prove feature reuse is a competitive alternative to rapid learning in MAML, the authors proposed a simplified algorithm, ANIL, where the inner loop is removed for all but the task-specific head of the underlying neural network during training and testing. ANIL vs. MAML Now, let us illustrate the difference mathematically. Let \\theta be the set of meta-initialization parameters for the feature extractable layers of the network and w be the meta-initialization parameters for the head. We obtain the label prediction \\hat{y} = w^T\\phi_\\theta(x) , where x is the input data and \\phi is a feature extractor parametrized by \\theta . Given \\theta_i and w_i at iteration step i , the outer loop updates both parameters via gradient descent: \\theta_{i+1} = \\theta_i - \\alpha\\nabla_{\\theta_i}\\mathcal{L}_{\\tau}(w^{\\prime \\top}_i\\phi_{\\theta^\\prime_i}(x), y) w_{i+1} = w_i - \\alpha\\nabla_{w_i}\\mathcal{L}_{\\tau}(w^{\\prime \\top}_i\\phi_{\\theta^\\prime_i}(x), y) where \\mathcal{L}_\\tau is the loss computed for task \\tau , and \\alpha is the meta learning rate in the outer loop. Notice how the gradient is taken with respect to the initialization parameters w_i and \\theta_i , but the loss is computed on the adapted parameters \\theta_i^\\prime and w_i^\\prime . For one adaptation step in the inner loop, ANIL computes those adapted parameters as: \\theta_{i}^\\prime = \\theta_i w_{i}^\\prime = w_i - \\beta\\nabla_{w_i}\\mathcal{L}_{\\tau}(w_i^T\\phi_{\\theta_i}(x), y) where \\beta is the learning rate of the inner loop. Concretely, ANIL keeps the feature extractor constant and only adapts the head with gradient descent. In contrast, MAML updates both the head and the feature extractor: \\theta_{i}^\\prime = \\theta_i - \\beta\\nabla_{\\theta_i}\\mathcal{L}_{\\tau}(w_i^T\\phi_{\\theta_i}(x), y) w_{i}^\\prime = w_i - \\beta\\nabla_{w_i}\\mathcal{L}_{\\tau}(w_i^T\\phi_{\\theta_i}(x), y). Unsurprisingly, ANIL is much more computationally efficient since it requires fewer updates in the inner loop. What might be surprising, is that this efficiency comes at almost no cost in terms of performance. Results ANIL provides fast adaptation in the absence of almost all inner loop parameter updates, while still matching the performance of MAML on few-shot image classification with Mini-ImageNet and Omniglot and standard reinforcement learning tasks.

An example implementation on the FC100 dataset is available at: anil_fc100.py . Using this implementation, we are able to obtain the following results on datasets such as Mini-ImageNet, CIFAR-FS and FC100 as well.

Creating dataset 1 2 3 4 train_dataset = l2l . vision . datasets . FC100 ( root = '~/data' , transform = tv . transforms . ToTensor (), mode = 'train' ) train_dataset = l2l . data . MetaDataset ( train_dataset ) First, data are obtained and separated into train, validation and test dataset with l2l.vision.datasets.FC100 . tv.transforms.ToTensor() converts Python Imaging Library (PIL) images to PyTorch tensors. l2l.data.MetaDataset is a thin wrapper around torch datasets that automatically generates bookkeeping information to create new tasks. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 train_transforms = [ FusedNWaysKShots ( train_dataset , n = ways , k = 2 * shots ), LoadData ( train_dataset ), RemapLabels ( train_dataset ), ConsecutiveLabels ( train_dataset ), ] train_tasks = l2l . data . TaskDataset ( train_dataset , task_transforms = train_transforms , num_tasks = 20000 ) l2l.data.TaskDataset creates a set of tasks from the MetaDataset using a list of task transformations: FusedNWaysKShots(dataset, n=ways, k=2*shots) : efficient implementation to keep k data samples from n randomly sampled labels. LoadData(dataset) : loads a sample from the dataset given its index. RemapLabels(dataset) : given samples from n classes, maps the labels to 0, \\dots, n . ConsecutiveLabels(dataset) : re-orders the samples in the task description such that they are sorted in consecutive order. Question Why k = 2*shots ? The number of samples k is twice the number of shots because one half of the samples are for adaption and the other half are for evaluation in the inner loop. Info For more details, please refer to the documentation of learn2learn.data . Creating model 1 2 3 4 5 6 features = l2l . vision . models . ConvBase ( output_size = 64 , channels = 3 , max_pool = True ) features = torch . nn . Sequential ( features , Lambda ( lambda x : x . view ( - 1 , 256 ))) features . to ( device ) head = torch . nn . Linear ( 256 , ways ) head = l2l . algorithms . MAML ( head , lr = fast_lr ) head . to ( device ) We then instantiate two modules, one for features and one for the head. ConvBase instantiates a four-layer CNN, and the head is a fully connected layer. Because we are not updating the feature extractor parameters, we only need to wrap the head with the l2l.algorithms.MAML() wrapper, which takes in the fast adaptation learning rate fast_lr used for the inner loop later. Info For more details on the MAML wrapper, please refer to the documentation of l2l.algorithms . Optimization setup 1 2 3 all_parameters = list ( features . parameters ()) + list ( head . parameters ()) optimizer = torch . optim . Adam ( all_parameters , lr = meta_lr ) loss = nn . CrossEntropyLoss ( reduction = 'mean' ) Next, we set up the optimizer with mini-batch SGD using torch.optim.Adam , which takes in both feature and head parameters, and learning rate meta_lr used for the outer loop. Outer loop 1 2 3 4 5 6 for iteration in range ( iters ): ... for task in range ( meta_bsz ): learner = head . clone () batch = train_tasks . sample () ... For training, validation and testing, we first sample a task, then copy the head with head.clone() , which is a method exposed by the MAML wrapper for PyTorch modules, akin to tensor.clone() for PyTorch tensors. Calling clone() allows us to update the parameters of the clone while maintaining ability to back-propagate to the parameters in head . There's no need for feature.clone() as we are only adapting the head.

In each adaptation step, learner.adapt() takes a gradient step on the loss and updates the cloned parameter, learner , such that we can back-propagate through the adaptation step. Under the hood, this is achieved by calling torch.autograd.grad() and setting create_graph=True . fast_adapt() then returns the evaluation loss and accuracy based on the predicted and true labels. Question Why is the number of adaptation steps so small? To demonstrate fast adaptation, we want the algorithm to adapt to each specific task quickly within a few steps. Since the number of samples is so small in few-shot learning, increasing number of adaptation steps would not help raising the performance. Closing the outer loop 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 evaluation_error . backward () meta_train_error += evaluation_error . item () meta_train_accuracy += evaluation_accuracy . item () ... # Average the accumulated gradients and optimize for p in all_parameters : p . grad . data . mul_ ( 1.0 / meta_bsz ) optimizer . step () We compute the gradients with evaluation_error.backward() right after the inner loop updates to free activation and adaptation buffers from memory as early as possible. Lastly, after collecting the gradients, we average the accumulated gradients and updates the parameter at the end of each iteration with optimizer.step() .

Given \\theta_i and w_i at iteration step i , the outer loop updates both parameters via gradient descent: \\theta_{i+1} = \\theta_i - \\alpha\\nabla_{\\theta_i}\\mathcal{L}_{\\tau}(w^{\\prime \\top}_i\\phi_{\\theta^\\prime_i}(x), y) w_{i+1} = w_i - \\alpha\\nabla_{w_i}\\mathcal{L}_{\\tau}(w^{\\prime \\top}_i\\phi_{\\theta^\\prime_i}(x), y) where \\mathcal{L}_\\tau is the loss computed for task \\tau , and \\alpha is the meta learning rate in the outer loop. Notice how the gradient is taken with respect to the initialization parameters w_i and \\theta_i , but the loss is computed on the adapted parameters \\theta_i^\\prime and w_i^\\prime . For one adaptation step in the inner loop, ANIL computes those adapted parameters as: \\theta_{i}^\\prime = \\theta_i w_{i}^\\prime = w_i - \\beta\\nabla_{w_i}\\mathcal{L}_{\\tau}(w_i^T\\phi_{\\theta_i}(x), y) where \\beta is the learning rate of the inner loop. Concretely, ANIL keeps the feature extractor constant and only adapts the head with gradient descent. In contrast, MAML updates both the head and the feature extractor: \\theta_{i}^\\prime = \\theta_i - \\beta\\nabla_{\\theta_i}\\mathcal{L}_{\\tau}(w_i^T\\phi_{\\theta_i}(x), y) w_{i}^\\prime = w_i - \\beta\\nabla_{w_i}\\mathcal{L}_{\\tau}(w_i^T\\phi_{\\theta_i}(x), y). Unsurprisingly, ANIL is much more computationally efficient since it requires fewer updates in the inner loop. What might be surprising, is that this efficiency comes at almost no cost in terms of performance. Results ANIL provides fast adaptation in the absence of almost all inner loop parameter updates, while still matching the performance of MAML on few-shot image classification with Mini-ImageNet and Omniglot and standard reinforcement learning tasks.

MetaDataset ( train_dataset ) First, data are obtained and separated into train, validation and test dataset with l2l.vision.datasets.FC100 . tv.transforms.ToTensor() converts Python Imaging Library (PIL) images to PyTorch tensors. l2l.data.MetaDataset is a thin wrapper around torch datasets that automatically generates bookkeeping information to create new tasks. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 train_transforms = [ FusedNWaysKShots ( train_dataset , n = ways , k = 2 * shots ), LoadData ( train_dataset ), RemapLabels ( train_dataset ), ConsecutiveLabels ( train_dataset ), ] train_tasks = l2l . data . TaskDataset ( train_dataset , task_transforms = train_transforms , num_tasks = 20000 ) l2l.data.TaskDataset creates a set of tasks from the MetaDataset using a list of task transformations: FusedNWaysKShots(dataset, n=ways, k=2*shots) : efficient implementation to keep k data samples from n randomly sampled labels. LoadData(dataset) : loads a sample from the dataset given its index. RemapLabels(dataset) : given samples from n classes, maps the labels to 0, \\dots, n . ConsecutiveLabels(dataset) : re-orders the samples in the task description such that they are sorted in consecutive order. Question Why k = 2*shots ? The number of samples k is twice the number of shots because one half of the samples are for adaption and the other half are for evaluation in the inner loop.

ConvBase instantiates a four-layer CNN, and the head is a fully connected layer. Because we are not updating the feature extractor parameters, we only need to wrap the head with the l2l.algorithms.MAML() wrapper, which takes in the fast adaptation learning rate fast_lr used for the inner loop later.

Optimization setup 1 2 3 all_parameters = list ( features . parameters ()) + list ( head . parameters ()) optimizer = torch . optim . Adam ( all_parameters , lr = meta_lr ) loss = nn . CrossEntropyLoss ( reduction = 'mean' ) Next, we set up the optimizer with mini-batch SGD using torch.optim.Adam , which takes in both feature and head parameters, and learning rate meta_lr used for the outer loop.

For training, validation and testing, we first sample a task, then copy the head with head.clone() , which is a method exposed by the MAML wrapper for PyTorch modules, akin to tensor.clone() for PyTorch tensors. Calling clone() allows us to update the parameters of the clone while maintaining ability to back-propagate to the parameters in head . There's no need for feature.clone() as we are only adapting the head.

In each adaptation step, learner.adapt() takes a gradient step on the loss and updates the cloned parameter, learner , such that we can back-propagate through the adaptation step. Under the hood, this is achieved by calling torch.autograd.grad() and setting create_graph=True . fast_adapt() then returns the evaluation loss and accuracy based on the predicted and true labels. Question Why is the number of adaptation steps so small? To demonstrate fast adaptation, we want the algorithm to adapt to each specific task quickly within a few steps. Since the number of samples is so small in few-shot learning, increasing number of adaptation steps would not help raising the performance.
